Project Description

In this project, we plan to create an application for the campus store to help customers customize existing products. This application is called Your METU Style(YMS). Currently, our campus store doesn't have an online shopping webpage therefore people are not able to order products online. Also, users cannot customize their products. Therefore, the project's main goal is to help customers order products and personalize these products easily. Also, they may order products without customizing them. To order products from the Campus Store, users need to register and log in to their user accounts. Also, Campus Store managers have an admin page to receive orders and add products to the application. In this application, users can customize the products in different ways. Firstly, users can enter text with various fonts, colors, or sizes they want to print on the product. Also, they are allowed to choose the place of the text on the product. Secondly, they can upload different .png or .jpg folders to be printed on products. To sum up, users can order their customized products and purchase through our web application via an online payment system.
